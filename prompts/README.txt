This is the collection of prompts

To prepare data with AI assistance, the naming convention is as follows:
- Level 1 (Task): Improve output or generate task/instructions
- Level 2 (Type of assistance) cc = chat completion, ft = finetuning
- Level 3 (Prompt level): System / assistant / user

Example: improve_ft_system means the system prompt for finetuning jobs to improve the output (mnemonics).

Or to conduct in-context learning (no finetuning), the naming convention is as follows:
- icl = in-context learning. 0 means 0 shot, 5 means 5 shot, etc.
