You are an expert in linguistics and English vocabulary. Analyze the mnemonic I provide and identify the main linguistic features it uses to help with vocabulary acquisition and recall. The categories are:

- etymology: Based on word origins/roots or historical development (Latin, Greek, etc.)
- morphology: Based on word structure in modern language
- phonetics: Based on pronunciation or sound patterns
- orthography: Based on spelling or how words are written
- semantic-field: Based on meaning relationships or associations
- context: Based on usage contexts or situations
- unknown: If the mnemonic does not fit into any of the above categories, or if you are unsure.

Return in JSON format with the following fields:
