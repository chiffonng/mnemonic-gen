\section*{Executive Summary}
Note: Due to limited compute, some experiments conducted are small-scale and need more data for robust validation and conclusion. However, the codebase is reproducible and scalable when there is more compute.

Tags: computational linguistics, natural language processing, large language model, language education, english as a foreign language, vocabulary acquisition, synthetic data generation.
