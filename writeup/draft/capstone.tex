\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Vocabulary acquisition remains a persistent challenge for English language learners, particularly at intermediate to advanced levels where abstract and academic terminology predominates. Mnemonics (or memory devices) are cognitive tools that help learners create associations between new vocabulary and familiar conceptsâ€”serve as valuable tools for enhancing retention and recall. The deeper leaners cognitively engage with the connection between the mnemonic and the target vocabulary, the better they are able to remember the term in the long term [cite]. However, creating such effective mnemonics demands both linguistic expertise and creative effort, presenting a significant barrier for most learners.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities as both knowledge bases \citep{petroni2019language, roberts2020much} and creative text generators \citep{brown2020language}, suggesting their potential for automated mnemonic generation. They are trained on vast pre-training data, which includes linguistic sources like \emph{wikitionary}, \emph{WordNet}, and \emph{ConceptNet}, enabling them to capture rich semantic and syntactic knowledge (on the word and sentence levels). By fine-tuning LLMs on a curated dataset of vocabulary-mnemonic pairs, we aim to bring out their linguistic knowledge to generate effective, creative mnemonics for English vocabulary learning.

Prior work has explored automated mnemonic generation through computational methods. \textsc{TransPhoner}, which generates keyword mnemonics by aligning phonetic similarities and semantic meanings across languages. Building upon this, \textsc{SmartPhone} utilized LLMs to produce both verbal and visual cues. ... proposed an \textsc{Overgenerate-and-Rank} approach that prompts LLMs to generate multiple mnemonic candidates and evaluate them based on imageability and coherence. Most recently, ... introduced \textsc{Smart}, which fine-tuned LLaMA-2-70B on a dataset of 800 crowdsourced mnemonics and applied preference optimization to align outputs with learner preferences and learning outcomes.

Despite their contributions, these methods have two limitations. First, they predominantly employ keyword method, which inadequate for abstract vocabulary that lacks concrete or imageable referents. By focusing on only one common mnemonic strategy, they typically neglect the rich linguistic knowledge embedded in LLMs that could provide diverse mnemonic strategies beyond simple keyword associations. Second, prior works passively hands generated mnemonics to learners. While \textsc{Smart} was further trained on learner preferences, they were \textit{aggregated}, which may not align with individual learning preferences. Research shows that language learners who use self-created mnemonics are more likely to retain them and for longer duration [cite].

This paper addresses these gaps by investigating whether LLMs are reliable \emph{linguistic} knowledge bases for generating effective English vocabulary mnemonics. We posit that through appropriate fine-tuning, LLMs can leverage their inherent linguistic knowledge to produce mnemonics that incorporate diverse linguistic features including morphology, etymology, phonology, and semantics. We introduce \shorttitle, a pipeline that mines linguistic knowledge from LLMs for mnemonic generation, and evaluate the relevance, diversity, and memorability of the generated mnemonics.
Our primary research questions are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can we mine linguistic knowledge from LLMs to generate effective mnemonic devices for English vocabulary learning?
\item Does fine-tuning LLMs on linguistically annotated vocabulary-mnemonic pairs improve mnemonic quality across dimensions of relevance, diversity, and helpfulness?
\item Which linguistic features contribute most significantly to mnemonic effectiveness?
\end{enumerate}
To answer these questions, we make the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A curated dataset of 1,300+ vocabulary-mnemonic pairs, including 130 examples manually annotated with linguistic reasoning patterns (Section \ref{sec:met-data}).
\item A fine-tuning pipeline that enhances LLMs' ability to utilize linguistic knowledge for mnemonic generation
\item Comprehensive evaluation metrics for assessing mnemonic quality across semantic relevance, linguistic diversity, and learner-rated helpfulness
\item Comparative analysis of prompting baseline versus fine-tuned models, and with prompt variants
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background} \label{sec:background}
\subsection{Mnemonics in Vocabulary Learning} \label{sec:mnemonics}
Mnemonics are cognitive strategies that facilitate memory retention by forming associations between new information and pre-existing knowledge. In vocabulary learning, mnemonics leverage various linguistic features to create memorable associations. These techniques can be categorized based on the depth of cognitive processing they engage:

\paragraph{Shallow-encoding} These involve surface-level associations, such as phonetic mnemonics, where the sound of a new term is linked to familiar words or phrases.
\paragraph{Deep-encoding} These involve meaningful connections, such as etymological cues that relate a word's origin to its meaning, fostering deeper understanding and recall.

Research indicates that deep-encoding strategies typically yield superior long-term retention, particularly for abstract vocabulary \citep{craik1975depth, atkinson1975mnemotechnics, oxford1990language}. However, they also require greater linguistic knowledge and creative effort to implement effectively.

\subsection{Large Language Models as Linguistic Knowledge Bases} \label{sec:llm-linguistics}

Large Language Models (LLMs) encode substantial linguistic knowledge acquired during pre-training on vast text corpora. This knowledge spans multiple linguistic dimensions:
\paragraph{Phonological knowledge} encompasses sound patterns and pronunciation. LLMs demonstrate this knowledge through capabilities like rhyme generation and phonetic similarity recognition, despite training primarily on written text.
\paragraph{Morphological knowledge} involves understanding word formation and structure. LLMs exhibit awareness of morphemes (the smallest meaningful units in language), as evidenced by their ability to analyze derivational patterns (e.g., recognizing that "unhappiness" contains the prefix "un-", root "happy", and suffix "-ness"). However, as seen in section ... about how LLMs understand and generate text, this morphological kno
\paragraph{Semantic knowledge} encompasses word meanings and relationships. LLMs capture semantic associations between words, enabling them to generate synonyms, antonyms, and contextually relevant terms.
\subsection{Neural Language Models and Transformer Architecture} \label{sec:pre-lm}

Neural language models (LMs) are probabilistic frameworks that assign probabilities to sequences of words or subword units, known as tokens. A token is the smallest unit of text that the model processes, which can be as granular as individual characters, subwords, or entire words, depending on the tokenization strategy employed.

Given a sequence of tokens \( \mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T) \), a language model estimates the joint probability \( P(\mathbf{x}) \) by factorizing it into conditional probabilities:

\[
P(\mathbf{x}) = \prod_{t=1}^T P(x_t \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{t-1})
\]

At each timestep \( t \), the model predicts the next token \( x_t \) based on the preceding sequence \( (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{t-1}) \). This autoregressive approach enables the generation of coherent text by sequentially predicting subsequent tokens.

The Transformer architecture [cite] underpins many state-of-the-art language models due to its efficiency and capability to model long-range dependencies. It utilizes self-attention mechanisms to weigh the relevance of each token in a sequence relative to others, regardless of their positions. The architecture comprises stacked layers, each including multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks, facilitating parallelization and effective learning of complex patterns in data.

\subsubsection{Tokenizer} \label{sec:pre-tokenizer}

A tokenizer is a preprocessing tool that converts raw text into tokens, aligning the text with the LM's vocabulary. Tokenizers can employ various strategies, such as word-based, character-based, or subword-based tokenization, each with distinct advantages and use cases.

\paragraph{Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)} is a subword tokenization algorithm that operates on the byte representation of text, enabling consistent handling of various scripts and special characters. It iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of adjacent bytes to form subword units, constructing a vocabulary that efficiently represents the training corpus. This method allows the tokenizer to decompose rare words into meaningful subword components, enhancing the model's capacity to process diverse and unseen terms.

For instance, the word "preposterous" might be tokenized into subwords like "pre", "post", and "erous," facilitating the model's understanding and generation of such terms. Subword tokenization is particularly effective for handling morphologically complex languages and out-of-vocabulary words, enhancing the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.


\subsection{Family of Fine-Tuning Methods}
Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task T or domain D by updating its parameters on a target dataset \(\mathcal{D}\). This process is crucial for leveraging pre-trained models' knowledge and enhancing their performance on downstream tasks.

There are several approaches to fine-tuning, which can be categorized by: 1. the availability of labeled data (supervised vs unsupervised fine-tuning), 2. the extent of parameter updates (full-parameter vs parameter-efficient fine-tuning), and 3. task. We focus on supervised fine-tuning, which involves minimizing a task-specific loss function over a labeled dataset.

\subsubsection{Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)}\label{sec:pre-sft}

SFT involves adapting a pre-trained model to a target task by minimizing a task-specific loss function over a labeled dataset. For a dataset \( \mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^N \), where \( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \) is the input and \( \mathbf{y}^{(i)} \) is the target output, the objective is to minimize:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ell(f(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}; \theta), \mathbf{y}^{(i)})
\]

where \( f(\mathbf{x}; \theta) \) represents the model's output with parameters \( \theta \), and \( \ell \) is the loss function, typically cross-entropy loss.

\paragraph{Instruction-Tuning} \label{sec:pre-it}

Instruction-tuning is a specialized form of SFT where models are trained on datasets comprising instruction-response pairs. This approach enables models to generalize across various tasks described by natural language instructions, enhancing their ability to follow diverse prompts. Formally, an instruction-tuning dataset consists of pairs \( \{(\mathbf{I}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^N \) or triplets \( \{(\mathbf{I}^{(i)}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{y}^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^N \), where \( \mathbf{I}^{(i)} \) denotes the instruction, \( \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \) is the optional input, and \( \mathbf{y}^{(i)} \) is the desired output. The training objective is to minimize the loss:

\[
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ell(f(\mathbf{I}^{(i)}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)}; \theta), \mathbf{y}^{(i)})
\]

where \( f \) represents the model parameterized by \( \theta \), and \( \ell \) is the loss function measuring the discrepancy between the model's prediction and the target output.

\subsubsection{Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning} \label{sec:peft}
Full-parameter fine-tuning updates \textit{all} parameters of a pre-trained model on the target dataset, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods adjust only a subset of the parameters, reducing computational and storage requirements while maintaining performance.

The most common PEFT method is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and its variants. They are used in the training process.

\paragraph{Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)} \label{sec:pre-lora}
It decomposes the weight updates into low-rank matrices, reducing the number of trainable parameters. Specifically, for a weight matrix \( W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k} \), LoRA introduces two low-rank matrices \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r} \) and \( B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k} \), where \( 0 < r \ll \min(d, k) \). The adapted weight is:

\[
W' = W + \alpha \cdot A B
\]

Here, \( \alpha \) is a scaling factor that controls the contribution of the low-rank adaptation. The rank \( r \) determines the capacity of the adaptation, balancing between expressiveness and efficiency.

LoRA introduces \( 2dr \) trainable parameters (size of \( A \) and \( B \)), which is significantly smaller than the original \( dk \) parameters. This reduction in parameters enables efficient fine-tuning of large models on limited hardware. In practice, LoRA is applied to specific modules of the model, such as attention and feed-forward layers, to balance performance and efficiency.

\subparagraph{Quantized LoRA (QLoRA)} \label{sec:pre-qlora}

QLoRA enhances LoRA by applying quantization to the pre-trained model's weights, enabling efficient fine-tuning of large models on limited hardware. Specifically, it utilizes 4-bit quantization to compress the model, allowing backpropagation through the quantized weights into the low-rank adapters. This approach significantly reduces memory usage while preserving performance.

Quantization techniques are used to represent data with fewer bits. In QLoRA, the quantization process involves mapping the high-precision weights to a lower-precision format, which reduces the memory footprint (e.g., from 32-bit floating-point to 4-bit integer). During fine-tuning, gradients are backpropagated through these quantized weights into the low-rank adapters introduced by LoRA.

\subparagraph{Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA)} \label{sec:pre-rslora}

rsLoRA modifies the scaling factor in LoRA to improve performance across different ranks. The standard scaling factor \( \gamma_r = \alpha / r \) can slow learning for higher ranks. rsLoRA proposes adjusting the scaling factor to \( \gamma_r = \alpha / \sqrt{r} \), enhancing fine-tuning performance without increasing inference costs.

\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning} \label{sec:pre-hyperparam-tuning}

Hyperparameter tuning is the process of optimizing parameters that govern the training process. The goal is to find the hyperparameter set \( \Lambda \) that minimizes the validation loss:

\[
\Lambda^* = \arg\min_{\Lambda} \mathcal{L}_{\text{val}}(\theta^*(\Lambda))
\]

where \( \theta^*(\Lambda) \) are the model parameters obtained after training with hyperparameters \( \Lambda \).

In the context of SFT and LoRA, relevant hyperparameters include: learning rate (\( \alpha \)) that controls the step size during gradient descent, batch size (\( B \)) that determines the number of training examples utilized in one iteration, LoRA rank (\( r \)) that determines the dimensionality of the low-rank matrices, and LoRA scaling factor (\( \alpha_{\text{LoRA}} \)) that controls the contribution of the low-rank adaptation in LoRA.

\subsubsection{Population-Based Training (PBT)} \label{sec:pbt}

Population-based training (PBT) is an optimization technique for finding optimal parameters and hyperparameters. It maintains a population of hyperparameter configurations, evolving them over time based on performance. Unlike grid search, which exhaustively evaluates a predefined set of hyperparameters, population-based search explores the hyperparameter space more efficiently by exploiting and exploring promising regions, leading to faster convergence to optimal configurations.

\subsection{Dialogue Systems} \label{sec:dialogue}

Dialogue systems, or conversational agents, are designed to interact with users through natural language. They can be categorized into two main types: task-oriented systems and open-domain systems. The former focuses on completing specific tasks, while the latter engages in general conversations across various topics (a notable example is OpenAI's ChatGPT).

These systems are effective interface for user interaction, and could be used to collect their feedback on the responses generated by the model, to further align the model's outputs with user preferences.

\section{Data Construction} \label{sec:met-data}
\subsection{Dataset Curation and Annotation} \label{sec:curation}
We constructed \textsc{MnemonicEN}, a dataset of 1,309 English vocabulary-mnemonic pairs designed to capture diverse linguistic associations. This dataset combines:
\begin{itemize}
\item 800+ manually curated examples focusing on abstract and academic vocabulary
\item 500+ examples from \textsc{Smart}, which was crawled from mnemonicdictionary.com
\end{itemize}
To enhance the dataset's linguistic depth, we manually annotated 130 examples with explicit linguistic reasoning patterns that connect target vocabulary to their mnemonics. These annotations categorize the primary linguistic features leveraged in each mnemonic:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Morphological reasoning} (28\%): Identifies word formation patterns through roots, prefixes, and suffixes
\item \textbf{Etymological reasoning} (22\%): Traces historical word origins and development
\item \textbf{Semantic reasoning} (31\%): Establishes meaningful associations through synonyms, antonyms, or related concepts
\item \textbf{Phonological reasoning} (19\%): Utilizes sound patterns and pronunciation similarities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preprocessing and Quality Control} \label{sec:preprocessing}
The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing to ensure consistency and quality:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Deduplication:} Removed duplicate entries and consolidated multiple mnemonics for the same vocabulary item
\item \textbf{Normalization:} Standardized formatting, corrected spelling errors, and ensured consistent tense and voice
\item \textbf{Quality filtering:} Excluded mnemonics that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Employed circular reasoning (using the target word to define itself)
\item Contained factual inaccuracies in etymological or semantic content
\item Lacked clear associations with the target vocabulary
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Diversity enhancement:} Ensured balanced representation across linguistic categories and vocabulary difficulty levels
\end{enumerate}
The resulting dataset covers vocabulary from intermediate (CEFR B1-B2) to advanced (CEFR C1-C2) English proficiency levels, with particular emphasis on abstract and academic terms that typically challenge learners.

\subsection{Dataset Statistics} \label{sec:dataset-stats}
The final dataset for finetuning comprises:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1,309 unique English vocabulary terms
\item Average word length: 8.4 characters
\item Average mnemonic length (with linguistic reasoning): 100.7 words
\item Frequency analysis: 72\% of vocabulary items fall outside the 5,000 most frequent English words, confirming the dataset's focus on advanced vocabulary
\end{itemize}

For experimental purposes, we split the dataset into 80\% training and 20\% validation sets. We leave out 200 examples for evaluation.
For the annotated subset (130 examples), we ensured balanced distribution across training and evaluation sets to maintain representation of linguistic reasoning categories.

\section{Experimental Setup} \label{sec:experiments}
\subsection{Models and Baselines} \label{sec:models}
We evaluated both open-source and closed-source LLMs to assess linguistic knowledge extraction across different model architectures:
\paragraph{Baseline Models:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{OpenAI GPT-4o-mini} (closed-source): A state-of-the-art instruction-following model representing commercial capabilities
\item \textbf{Google Gemma-2-9B-it} (open-source): A 9-billion parameter instruction-tuned model representing accessible open-source alternatives
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Fine-tuned Variants:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{OpenAI GPT-4o-mini-ft}: Fine-tuned using OpenAI's SFT API
\item \textbf{Gemma-2-9B-it-ft}: Fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques (QLoRA with rsLoRA scaling)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prompting Strategies} \label{sec:prompting}
We evaluated multiple prompting configurations to establish strong baselines:
\paragraph{Zero-shot prompting} provided minimal guidance:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{Create a mnemonic device for the English vocabulary "[target]" so that I could remember its meaning and spelling.}
\end{quote}
\paragraph{Few-shot prompting} included $k$ exemplars demonstrating desired patterns:

\begin{quote}
\texttt{Create a mnemonic for English vocabulary "[target]" that help learners remember both meaning and spelling. Here are some examples:}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Linguistic-aware prompting} explicitly requested linguistic analysis:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{Create a mnemonic for the English word "[target]". Analyze its morphology, etymology, or sound patterns, then create a memorable association that explains its meaning and spelling.}

\end{quote}

\subsection{Fine-tuning Methodology} \label{sec:ft-methodology}
For OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, we prepared fine-tuning data in the required JSONL format compliant with the OpenAI fine-tuning API. 130 annotated examples were splitted into 104 training and 26 evaluation. We used the OpenAI fine-tuning API to fine-tune the model on the training set for 3 epochs with a batch size of 4. The model was evaluated on the validation set after each epoch to monitor performance. With training loss and validation both around 0.6, in theory the model should be not be overfitting, and be able to generalize well to unseen data, our main dataset.

After the quality of the dataset was improved, we fine-tuned the Gemma-2-9B-it model on this improved dataset. We employed parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, specifically QLoRA with rsLoRA scaling. For more details, refer to the Appendix \ref{sec:training-details}.

Both fine-tuning processes incorporated the linguistic reasoning annotations as part of the target outputs, encouraging models to learn explicit reasoning patterns alongside mnemonic generation.

\subsection{Evaluation Setup} \label{sec:evaluation-metrics}
\subsubsection{Semantic Relevance} \label{sec:relevance-eval}
Semantic relevance is the measure of semantic alignment between the target vocabulary and the generated mnemonic. We evaluated this through a computational metric, \textbf{cosine similarity}, and human evaluation.

\paragraph{Embedding-based similarity} calculated cosine similarity between target vocabulary and generated mnemonic embeddings. High cosine similarity scores indicate that the mnemonic captures the semantic essence of the target word, serving as an automated measure of relevance.
\paragraph{Human relevance assessment} involved rating of 50 randomly selected test examples on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 being completely irrelevant and 5 being highly relevant and accurate. Three raters, with either linguistic background or language learning experience, independently rated the mnemonics to ensure consistency. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was measured using Gwet's AC2, a measure used to calculate the agreement between more than two raters on ordinal ratings such as Likert scale.

\subsubsection{Linguistic Diversity} \label{sec:diversity-eval}
Linguistic diversity assesses the variety of linguistic features leveraged in mnemonics, measured through:
\paragraph{Linguistic feature classification} assigned each mnemonic to categories (morphological, etymological, semantic, phonological) based on prominent linguistic features. We calculated Shannon entropy across these categories, with higher entropy indicating more diverse feature utilization.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
\subsection{Semantic Relevance} \label{sec:relevance-results}
Fine-tuned models demonstrated superior semantic relevance compared to baseline approaches:

\subsection{HCs} \label{sec:hcs}
\numpara{gapanalysis}	Section \ref{sec:intro} provides a gap analysis of previous works on mnemonic generation, identifying the limitations of existing approaches and the need for a more diverse and engaging mnemonic generation system. Appendix \ref{sec:keyword-method} elaborates on how the keyword method lacks effectiveness for abstract vocabulary. Additionally, existing methods often neglect to actively engage learners in the mnemonic creation process. These identified gaps serve as the impetus for developing the current work to address these shortcomings.
\numpara{hypothesisdevelopment} The hypotheses in Section \ref{sec:intro} are formulated to test the efficacy of the proposed mnemonic generation system \textsc{MnemonicChat}. These hypotheses closely follow the format If-Then-Because, providing both clear predictions and justifications for the expected outcomes. The hypotheses also address difference aspects of the generated mnemonics and the system itself. Section \ref{sec:evaluation-metrics} show that they are testable by providing specific metrics and evaluation methods. By framing these claims as testable hypotheses, the project establishes a rigorous framework for evaluating the system's performance and validating its effectiveness through empirical analysis.
\numpara{optimization} To enhance refine the system performance and enhance its ability to generate effective mnemonics, the project employs a systematic optimization process. The objective function is to minimize the evaluation loss on the validation set (while the training is done on the training set). Appropriate fine-tuning strategies are selected, such as LoRA and instruction tuning, and hyperparameters are systemmatically tuned (section \ref{sec:pre-hyperparam-tuning}). This iterative optimization process is crucial for ensuring that \textsc{MnemonicChat} produces mnemonics that align with learner needs and facilitate effective vocabulary acquisition.

The research paper is tailored toward an academic audience, specifically researchers in the fields of natural language processing and students interested in this field of study. I provided Preliminaries to introduce key concepts and terminologies, making it more accessible to readers unfamiliar with the topic. The paper is structured to guide readers through the research process, employing a clear, concise, and technically rigorous writing style. The coding project, on the other hand, prioritizes coders and developers as its primary audience, emphasizing well-documented code, modular design, and adherence to industry standards to ensure readability, maintainability, and ease of use .
\numpara{organization} This paper is structured according to the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) template. This established template provides a clear and logical framework for presenting research findings in natural language processing and computational linguistics, ensuring a coherent flow of information from introduction to conclusion. The adoption of the ACL template enhances the paperâ€™s readability and facilitates effective communication of the projectâ€™s motivations, methodology, results, and implications.

\numpara{algorithms} The final paper will include a more detailed description and visual aid of the algorithm(s) used in the project, as described in Method (\ref{sec:method}). This will provide readers with a clear understanding of the technical processes involved in fine-tuning the Gemma-2 model and generating mnemonics. The algorithm description will be accompanied by pseudocode or flowcharts to illustrate the step-by-step procedures and computations involved in the system's operation. By presenting the algorithms in a structured and visual format, the paper will provide the clarity and comprehensibility of the technical content, enabling readers to grasp the underlying processes and methodologies employed in the project.
\numpara{heuristics} Diagrams (a type of external represetation, a problem-solving heuristic) will be used to illustrate the process in section \ref{sec:intro}. These visual aids will enhance the clarity and understanding of the training process and evaluation procedures. By incorporating diagrams, the paper provides readers with a visual representation of the project's components and processes, facilitating comprehension and retention of complex information.
\numpara{sampling} A subset of generated mnemonics will be randomly selected for human evaluation to ensure a representative sample of the model's outputs. This random sampling strategy prevents bias and ensures that the evaluation results accurately reflect the overall quality and effectiveness of the generated mnemonics. Given the financial constraints, the author could not recruit a large number of human evaluators, so there is a risk of sampling bias. However, the random selection of mnemonics mitigates this risk to some extent, providing a less biased assessment of the model's performance.
\numpara{studyreplication} The project aims to ensure the replicability of the experiments and results by providing detailed descriptions and reproducible code for the methodology, datasets, and evaluation procedures.

\numpara{observationalstudy} The project involves an observational study to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated mnemonics. Human evaluators will rate the relevance of the mnemonics, and users will provide feedback on the chatbot interface. These observations will be used to assess the impact of the system on mnemonic quality and user engagement. By collecting and analyzing observational data, the project gains valuable insights into the system's performance and user experience, informing future iterations and improvements.
\numpara{dataviz} Data visualizations will be used to present the results of the experiments, such as bar charts for mnemonic relevance scores and line graphs for model performance over epochs. These visualizations enhance the clarity and interpretability of the findings, enabling readers to grasp complex information quickly and effectively. The use of visual aids also aligns with best practices in scientific communication, enhancing the overall quality and impact of the research paper.
\numpara{significance} Significance testing will be conducted to determine whether the results obtained from the experiments are statistically significant. This will involve applying appropriate statistical tests, such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, to compare the performance of different models and evaluate the impact of the system on mnemonic quality.
\numpara{shapingbehavior} The chatbot interface is designed to shape user behavior by encouraging engagement and interaction with the system. Users are prompted to provide feedback on the generated mnemonics, fostering active participation and collaboration in the learning process. By shaping user behavior through feedback mechanisms, the chatbot promotes user engagement and enhances the quality of the generated mnemonics, ultimately improving the system's effectiveness in facilitating vocabulary acquisition.
\numpara{ethicalconsiderations} The project adheres to ethical guidelines by ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of user data collected during the chatbot interactions. User feedback is anonymized and aggregated to protect individual identities. Informed consent is obtained from participants involved in the human evaluation studies, and they are informed of the study's purpose and procedures. The project also prioritizes transparency and accountability in reporting the results, ensuring that the findings are presented accurately and objectively. By upholding ethical standards, the project maintains integrity and trustworthiness in its research practices and outcomes.
\section{Mnemonics and their Strategies} \label{sec:mnemonic-strategies}
\subsection{Keyword Method and Its Limitations} \label{sec:keyword-method}

The keyword method is a mnemonic technique designed to facilitate vocabulary acquisition by associating unfamiliar foreign language words with familiar native language words or phrases that sound similar. This association typically involves creating a vivid mental image linking the keyword to the foreign word's meaning, thereby enhancing recall. For example, to remember that the Spanish word "carta" means "letter," one might visualize a shopping cart carrying a postal letter, leveraging the phonetic similarity between "carta" and "cart."

While effective for concrete nouns, the keyword method encounters significant challenges with abstract vocabulary. Abstract terms often lack direct physical representations, making it difficult to devise concrete keywords or mental images. This limitation hampers the method's applicability to more complex or intangible concepts, which are prevalent at advanced stages of language learning. Consequently, learners may find the keyword method less beneficial for mastering abstract or technical vocabulary, necessitating alternative mnemonic strategies to address these gaps.

\section{Challenges in Prompting Language Models for Mnemonic Generation}

Employing large language models (LLMs) to generate mnemonics presents several challenges:

\subsection{Tail phenomenon}

The term "mnemonic" is predominantly associated with acronyms in the training data of LMs. This bias leads models to favor acronym-based mnemonics, which are useful for organizing and memorizing long information (such as medical terms) instead of learning and retaining the meaning of individual words. As a result, the model may generate mnemonics that prioritize acronym formation over semantic relevance, potentially hindering learners' understanding and recall of the target vocabulary.

\subsection{Trial-and-error nature of prompting}

Crafting prompts to elicit desired outputs from LLMs is often an iterative and unpredictable process. The black-box nature of these models means that even with knowledge of prompt engineering techniques, achieving consistent and accurate results can be challenging. This unpredictability poses significant difficulties for users without extensive experience in prompt formulation, as they may struggle to generate effective mnemonics reliably. Moreover, the lack of transparency in how LLMs interpret and respond to prompts further complicates the development of precise and effective mnemonic generation strategies.

\section{Training details} \label{sec:training-details}
\subsection{Environment setup}
The training was conducted, alternately, on a Google Colab notebook, or an instance of Google Cloud's Deep Learning Virtual Machine image. They both use Google Compute Engine and were configured with a NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU. HuggingFace libraries \verb|bitsandbytes| (quantization), \verb|peft| (parameter-efficient fine-tuning), \verb|transformers|, \verb|trl| (transformer reinforcement learning), were loaded with \verb|torch| backend and CUDA support. \verb|unsloth| was used to reduce memory usage when interacting with LMs at the cost of small training speed.

The base model used was Gemma-2-9B-it, a 9-billion parameter Transformer-based decoder-only language model pre-trained on general-purpose tasks, and already fine-tuned to increase instruction following capabilities.

\subsection{LoRA configuration}

To reduce computational overhead, we employed QLoRA with Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA) scaling. The model was quantized to 4-bit precision using \texttt{unsloth}, which utilizes the \texttt{bitsandbytes} library, thereby decreasing memory usage. The LoRA configuration parameters were set as follows: rank \( r = 8 \), scaling factor \( \alpha_{\text{LoRA}} = 16 \), and dropout rate of 0. These configurations were applied to both the attention and feed-forward layers.

The rank \( r \) determines the dimensionality of the low-rank adaptation matrices, controlling the number of trainable parameters introduced during fine-tuning. A higher rank allows the model to capture more complex adaptations but increases computational complexity. The scaling factor \( \alpha_{\text{LoRA}} \) modulates the impact of the low-rank updates on the original weights, effectively controlling the contribution of the adaptation matrices to the final model parameters. Setting the dropout rate to zero indicates that no dropout regularization was applied during the LoRA updates, allowing all connections to be utilized during training.

\subsection{SFT configuration}

For supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we utilized the \texttt{trl} library with the following hyperparameters: batch size \( b = 16 \), number of epochs \( \text{eps} = 4 \), learning rate \( \alpha = 2 \times 10^{-5} \), weight decay \( \lambda = 0.05 \), and a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler with restarts.

The batch size \( b \) defines the number of training examples processed simultaneously during each forward and backward pass. A batch size of 16 balances computational efficiency and gradient estimation accuracy. Training for 4 epochs (\( \text{eps} = 4 \)) means the model will see the training data a total of four times, which ensures sufficient exposure to the training data without risking overfitting. The learning rate \( \alpha \) controls the step size for weight updates; a value of \( 2 \times 10^{-5} \) is typical for fine-tuning large language models, facilitating gradual convergence. Weight decay \( \lambda \) serves as a regularization term, penalizing large weights to prevent overfitting. The cosine annealing scheduler adjusts the learning rate following a cosine decay pattern, periodically restarting to allow the model to escape local minima and potentially achieve better generalization, compared to linear decay.

\subsection{Hyperparameter tuning}

To optimize the training process, PBT was used to explore hyperparameter configurations dynamically. Initial ranges included: learning rate $\alpha \in [1e^{-5}, 3e^{-5}]$, batch size $b\in [8,32]$, weight decay $d\in[0.01,0.1]$, and learning schedulers (either linear or cosine annealing with restarts).

PBT iteratively refined these configurations based on evaluation loss on validation set.
