\section{Limitations} \label{sec:limitations}
Despite promising results, several limitations warrant acknowledgment. (1) Our evaluation focused primarily on intermediate measures of mnemonic quality rather than direct assessment of learning outcomes. Future work should include longitudinal studies measuring actual vocabulary retention. (2) our linguistic feature classification relied on manual annotation for a subset of examples, which may introduce inconsistencies. Finally, while our comparative analysis included both open and closed-source models, resource constraints limited the scale of fine-tuning experiments, particularly for larger models.

(4) The use of LLM-as-a-judge

\subsection{Future Work} \label{sec:future-work}
Future research directions include expanding linguistic annotations to cover a broader range of features and vocabulary types, developing automated methods for linguistic feature extraction, and exploring personalized mnemonic generation that adapts to individual learning preferences and styles. Additionally, integrating multimodal elements that combine visual and textual mnemonics could further enhance learning effectiveness, particularly for concrete vocabulary.
